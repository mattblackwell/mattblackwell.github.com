*(with [Michael Olson][])*

`inters` is an [R][] package with tools to estimate interactions. Currently, it implements the post-double-selection approach to estimating interactions described in this [working paper by Matthew Blackwell and Michael Olson][lasso-paper]. Note that this package is still in alpha stages and is under rapid development. Learn how to install it on the [github page][github].
