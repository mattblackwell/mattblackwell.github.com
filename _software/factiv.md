*(with [Nicole Pashley][])*

`factiv` is an [R][] package to analyze 2<sup>K</sup> factorial experiments with noncompliance. Currently, it implements the finite-population and superpopulation inference approaches described in [Blackwell and Pashley (2020)][BP2020]. Note that this package is still in early stages. Learn how to install it on the [github page][github].
