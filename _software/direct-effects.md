*(with [Avi Acharya][] and [Maya Sen][])*

DirectEffects is an [R][] package to estimate controlled direct effects. As of now, the only model supported is sequential g-estimation, but we plan to expand to other models, including doubly robust estimators, in the future. For more information on how CDEs can be useful for applied research and a brief introduction to sequential g-estimation, see our [2016 APSR][de-paper]. Note that this package is still in alpha stages and is under rapid development.
