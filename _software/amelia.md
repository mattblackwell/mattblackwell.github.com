(with [James Honaker][] and [Gary King][])

Amelia is an [R][] package for the multiple imputation of incomplete
data. Multiple imputation is a method to overcome the computational
problem of missing data while maintaining good statistical
properties. Amelia uses a bootstrap-based algorithm that increases
speed and robustness. In addition, Amelia includes a graphical user
interface that requires no knowledge of R at all.
