The dynamics of presidential elections are usually monitored with
state- and national-level polling data. Since polls are not conducted
in every state on every day, we usually smooth across time in some way
to make inferences; the support for the Democrat probably will not
change drastically from day to day. But when support does change, how
should it change? I introduce an extension of the usual Dynamic Linear
Model to smooth time-trends across the political space. That is, with
this model, two states that are politically similar should have
similar dynamics of support.
