*(with [Avi Acharya][] and [Maya Sen][])*

We show that contemporary differences in political attitudes across
counties in the American South trace their origins back to the
influence of slavery's prevalence more than 150 years ago. Whites who
currently live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves
population in 1860 are less likely to identify as Democrat, more
likely to oppose to affirmative action policies, and more likely to
express racial resentment toward blacks. These results are robust to
accounting for a variety of attributes, including contemporary shares
of black population, urban-rural differences, and Civil War
destruction, and strengthen when instrumenting for the prevalence of
slavery with agricultural cotton suitability. The results suggest that
political attitudes were at least in part determined by the local
prevalence of slavery and the political and economic incentives that
emancipation created for Southern whites. In turn, these attitudes
have been passed down from one generation to the next.
