*(with [Adam Glynn][], Working Paper)*

Time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data have played an increasingly
  important role in empirical political science research. The appeal
  of such repeated measurements is obvious: TSCS data allow for the
  identification and estimation of causal effects under weaker
  conditions than with purely cross-sectional data. However, this can
  also lead to confusion regarding which causal questions can be
  answered and which methods can answer them. In this paper, we
  demonstrate that a weighting approach to causal inference can
  estimate a wide array of causal quantities of interest and that
  other more commonly used approaches tend to perform poorly in the
  TSCS setting.  Furthermore, we extend the usual weighting techniques
  to handle situations where unit-specific unmeasured confounding
  exists. We demonstrate these methods with a set of simulation
  results and an application to the relationship between democracy and
  war.
