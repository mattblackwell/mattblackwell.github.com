Traditional single-shot causal inference models, which look at the
effects of a single action at a single point in time, are an
invaluable tool for political scientists. In many cases, though,
actions unfold over time, as political actors react to a shifting
state of affairs. Single-shot methods leave political scientists with
no way of extracting meaningful causal inferences about these dynamic
processes. With dynamic data, regression and matching methods force a
choice between two pernicious sources of bias, unable to
simultaneously correct for both. To avoid these problems, I introduce
a framework for dynamic causal inference and utilize marginal
structural models (MSM) to estimate dynamic causal effects. I take the
effectiveness of “going negative” as a motivating example, as
candidates change their strategy over the course of the electoral
calendar.  Furthermore, I provide practical guidance for these models,
introducing diagnostic tools and a sensitivity analysis framework for
their crucial, untestable assumptions.
