How can we detect voting irregularities? What causes individuals to vote? In what sense
(if any) does democracy (or trade) reduce the probability of war? Quantitative political
scientists address these questions and many others by using and developing statistical
methods that are informed by theories in political science and the social sciences
more generally. In this course, we provide an introduction to the tools used in basic
quantitative social science research. The first four weeks of the course cover introductory
univariate statistics, while the remainder of the course focuses on linear regression
models. Furthermore, the principles learned in this course provide a foundation for
the future study of more advanced topics in quantitative political methodology.
