(with [Stefano Iacus][],  [Giuseppe Porro][] and [Gary King][])

CEM is a package for [R][], Stata, and SPSS that implements the method
of coarsened exact matching. CEM improves causal inferences and
reduces model dependence by making observations more comparable. I
helped to write the Stata and SPSS packages.
