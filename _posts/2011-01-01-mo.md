*(With [James Honaker][] and [Gary King][], Under Review)*

Social scientists typically devote considerable effort to reducing
measurement error during data collection only to ignore the issue
during data analysis. Although many statistical methods have been
proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases, few have been
widely used because of implausible assumptions, high levels of model
dependence, difficult computation, or inapplicability with multiple
mismeasured variables. We develop an easy-to-use alternative that
generalizes the popular multiple imputation (MI) framework so that it
treats missing data problems as a special case of extreme measurement
error and corrects for both. Like MI, the proposed "multiple
overimputation" (MO) framework is a simple two-step procedure. First,
multiple (â‰ˆ5) completed copies of the dataset are created where cells
measured without error are held constant, those missing are imputed
from the distribution of predicted values, and cells (or entire
variables) with measurement error are "overimputed," that is imputed
from a predictive distribution with observation-level priors defined
by the mismeasured values and available external information, if
any. In the second step, analysts can then run whatever statistical
method they would have run on each of the overimputed datasets as if
there had been no missingness or measurement error; the results are
then combined via a simple procedure.
