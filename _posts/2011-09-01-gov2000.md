(Gov 1000/2000, Fall 2008, Prof. [Adam Glynn][ag], Teaching Fellow) 

A mandatory graduate class for first-year PhD students in the
Government Department at Harvard. It covers the linear model and its
extensions along with causal inference. For this class I wrote half
the problem sets and gave half of the section lectures. I received a
Certificate of Distinction in Teaching for this class with a mean
student evaluation of 4.8 out of 5. Taught with R.
