*(with [Avi Acharya][] and [Maya Sen][])*

The rigorous exploration of causal mechanisms has become increasingly important within social science research, with scholars seeking to rule out alternate explanations for their findings. However, existing methodologies leave applied researchers ill-equipped to convincingly rule out the possibility that alternate explanations are driving their findings. We introduce a methodology from the biostatistics literature and show that it easily allows for the exploration and elimination of rival causal explanations. This method, sequential g-estimation, estimates a more appropriate quantity of interest, the controlled direct effect of a treatment, which holds fixed the value of a mediator.  The method is easy to use, appropriate for the questions faced by social scientists, and based on significantly weaker assumptions than competing approaches. To illustrate the use of sequential g-estimation, we provide an empirical example drawn from the impact of U.S. slavery on Southern whites' contemporary attitudes.
