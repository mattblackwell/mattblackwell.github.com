*(with [Avi Acharya][] and [Maya Sen][])*

The rigorous exploration of causal mechanisms has become increasingly important within social science research. We make three contributions to the study of causal mechanisms. First, we introduce a new approach to thinking about causal mechanisms that focuses on a particular quantity of interest, the controlled direct effect. Second, we show that this approach, which we call *causal obstruction*, allows us to rule out alternative causal pathways and to detect whether a variable participates in a causal mechanism. Third, to estimate the controlled direct effect, we introduce a strategy from the biostatistics literature (Robins, 1994; Vansteelandt, 2009) called sequential g-estimation and provide two empirical examples, one on civil war and ethnic fractionalization from Fearon and Laitin (2003) and the other on the impact of the historical use of the plough on modern female political participation from Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2013). We conclude by assessing how causal obstruction contrasts and complements more traditional causal mediation analysis.
