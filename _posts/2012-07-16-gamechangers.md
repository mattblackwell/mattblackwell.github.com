*(Working Paper)*

In this paper, I introduce a Bayesian model for detecting
  changepoints in a time-series of contributions to candidates over
  the course of a campaign. This game-changers model is ideal
  for campaign contributions data because it allows for
  overdispersion, a key feature of contributions data. Furthermore,
  while many extant changepoint models force researchers to choose the
  number of changepoint ex ante, the game-changers model
  incorporates a Dirichlet process prior in order to estimate the
  number of changepoints along with their location. I demonstrate the
  usefulness of the model in data from the 2012 Republican primary and
  the 2008 U.S. Senate elections.
