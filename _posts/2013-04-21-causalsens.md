causalsens is an [R][] package to implement the selection bias approach to sensitivity analysis for causal effects as introduced in [Blackwell (2013)][senspaper]. This approach allows researchers to evaulate the effect of unmeasured confounders on their estimated effects varying both the strength and direction of the confounding.
