The estimation of causal effects has a revered place in all fields of
empirical political science, but a large volume methodological and
applied work ignores a fundamental fact: most people are skeptical of
estimated causal effects. In particular, researchers are often worried
about the assumption of no omitted variables or no unmeasured
confounders. This paper combines two approaches to sensitivity
analysis to provide researchers with a tool to investigate how
specific violations of no omitted variables alters their
estimates. This approach can help researchers determine which
narratives imply weaker results and which actually strengthen their
claims. This gives researchers and critics a reasoned and quantitative
approach to assessing the plausibility of causal effects. To
demonstrate the approach, I present applications to three causal
inference estimation strategies: regression, matching, and weighting.
