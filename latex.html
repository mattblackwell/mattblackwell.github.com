<h1>LaTeX Setup and Tutorial</h1>
<br /><br />
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>LaTeX is a markup language, which means it finds little snippets
of code in a plain text document and uses that to typeset the text. If
you're familiar with HTML, this is exactly what LaTeX is like. If
that analogy makes you more confused, perhaps think about it like this:
imagine the bits of code in your document are like a book editor's red
pen marks, indicating to the publisher how to print the text.
When you run LaTeX on your document, it is like sending your
manuscript to the printer, with instructions for how to print. They
send it back to you as a pdf. </p>

<p> So, great. What do we need? First we need a way to make the
manuscript (in the jargon: a tex file (sound like "tech")). Second
we need the typesetter/printer to send the manuscript to (in the 
jargon: a LaTeX compiler). How you accomplish both of these steps
depends on your operating system. The instructions below will guide
you through the installation of both the compiler and the editor for
both <a href="#windows">Windows</a> and <a href="#mac">Macs</a>. </p>

<p> To sum up: </p>
<ul>
<li> The <b>editor</b> helps you write your <b>.tex file</b> with LaTeX code. </li>
<li> The <b>compiler</b> reads your .tex file and makes a pretty
     document. </li>
</ul>
<a name="windows"></a><h2>Windows</h2>
<br /><br />
<h3>the compiler - MiKTeX</h3>
<p>The Windows LaTeX compiler is called MiKTeX and it will give your 
computer the power to compile .tex files. It also manages LaTeX packages,
which work very similarly to R packages. MiKTeX is a little scary, 
but hopefully once you install it, you won't have to deal with it
a whole lot. Think of it as setting up a really fast typesetter 
in your computer. </p>
<ol>

  <li>Go to <a href="http://www.miktex.org/2.7/Setup.aspx">www.miktex.org/2.7/Setup.aspx</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Download the "Basic MiKTeX 2.7" Installer</li>
  <li>Open up the installer and use all the default settings</li>
</ol>

<h3>the (free) editor - Texmaker</h3>
<p>The dual-edged sword aspect of LaTeX is that the .tex files are
actually just plain text. So, you could just use Notepad or Wordpad
or Word or some other program. These are fine, but there are other 
programs that will greatly expand your productivity in LaTeX. For 
Windows, we are going to recommend the free editor Texmaker. It has
fun stuff like syntax highlighting and buttons on the side 
with all of the math symbols, so you don't have to look them up every
time you write up a problem set. In addition, there are menu buttons 
and keyboard shortcuts that allow you to compile the .tex file. 
So, to install:
</p>

<ol>

  <li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html">http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html</a></li>

  <li>Click on <strong>Executable file for win32
systems :</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/texmakerwin32_install.exe">texmakerwin32_install.exe</a>.</li>

  <li>Run the installer and use all of the default settings.</li>

</ol>
Now that we have an editor, we can fire up some LaTeX and get to
your classic 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">hello 
world program</a>. Start by opening Texmaker and copying into it 
the following text:


{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass{article}
\title{Worlds Apart: Hello Worlds in the Comparative Context}
\author{Matt Blackwell}
\begin{document}
   \maketitle
   Hello world!
   $$f(x)=x^2$$
\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

Now: 

<ol>
    <li>Save the file in a convenient place as "helloworld.tex"</li>
    <li>Click on the button labeled "PDFLAT" to run pdflatex</li>
    <li>Click on the "View PDF" button to open Acrobat to view the resulting PDF</li>
</ol>



<a name="mac"></a><h2>Mac OS X</h2>
<br /><br />
<h3>the compiler - MacTeX</h3>
<p>
MacTeX is the basic Mac distribution of the LaTeX compiler. A bit of 
a warning: the download for this is over 1GB, so it might take a bit.
In addition, you have drive space limitations, you may want to consider
one of the stripped down versions of MacTeX. Wonderfully, MacTeX
installs a very slick editor called TeXShop. To obtain this compiler:
</p>
<ol>

  <li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://tug.org/mactex/">http://tug.org/mactex/</a></li>

  <li>Click and download: MacTeX.mpkg.zip</li>

  <li>Unzip and run the MacTeX.mpkg file, keeping all the defaults.</li>

</ol>


<h3>the (free) editor - TeXShop</h3>

<p>The dual-edged sword aspect of LaTeX is that the .tex files are
actually just plain text. So, you could just use any old text 
editor. These are fine, but there are other
programs that will greatly expand your productivity in LaTeX. For
Macs, we are going to recommend the editor that comes with MacTex,
called TeXShop. It will ease the LaTeX editing and compiling 
process. 
</p>


<p>Now that we have an editor, we can fire up some LaTeX and get to
your classic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">hello
world program</a>. Start by opening TexShop and copying into it
the following text:</p>

{% highlight latex%}
\documentclass{article}
\title{Worlds Apart: Hello Worlds in the Comparative Context}
\author{Matt Blackwell}
\begin{document}
   \maketitle
   Hello world!
   $$f(x)=x^2$$
\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}


Now:

<ol>
    <li>Save the file in a convenient place as "helloworld.tex"</li>
    <li>Click on the button labeled "Typeset" to run the compiler</li>
</ol>

You should see a pdf file with a title and all that. 

<h3>the (free) editor (ii) - Texmaker</h3>
You may find TeXShop a bit intimidating. It doesn't have the helpful
buttons for bold, italics, math symbols, etc. If you want these features,
you can always download Texmaker for Macs and use that. To obtain it:

<ol>

  <li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html">http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html</a></li>

  <li>Download the zip file for Mac OS X.</li>
  <li>Open the zip file and place the Texmaker application 
      somewhere that suits you.</li>
</ol>

Once you have installed Texmaker, you can use the example in the 
<a href="#windows">Windows</a> section to test out your installation. 

<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>There are a number of resources for LaTeX online. By a number, I mean
a very high number. Walking yourself through an online tutorial is
a good way to get familiar, but you'll probably learn LaTeX as you 
trying to type up your problem sets. This can be a frustrating experience,
but I think it's worth it in the long run. Even if you don't use any
math, your paper will have a
professional shine that makes some impact on the reader. </p>

<p>If you do get stuck, try to find the answer on your own first. Google
is your friend here. When I get stuck  on tables (which is often), I google: 
"latex tables." I've found that googling "latex+myproblem" is a good
way to answer almost any question. </p>

<p>Some other pages that are often used are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e</a>, by Tobias Oetiker. Comprehensive, will answer almost any question you have.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html">
LaTeX Tutorials</a>, from Andy Roberts. You don't need to worry 
about his section on "setting up LaTeX" but the rest is good, 
especially for beginners.</li>
