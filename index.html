Hello, I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the <a class="fn org url" href="http://www.gov.harvard.edu/">Department of
Government</a> at Harvard University. I am also an associate of the
<a class="fn org url" href="http://iq.harvard.edu">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>. 
In the 2010-2011 academic year I
will be the coordinator for
the <a href="http://www.iq.harvard.edu/applied_statistics_workshop_gov_3009">Applied
  Statistics Workshop</a> at IQSS. I am also a contributor to
the <a href="http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/">Social Science
Statistics blog</a> on occasion. 
</p><p>
My research focuses on political methodology and formal theory. In
methods, I work on missing data, causal inference, panel data and
social network analysis. In formal theory, I am interested in models
of belief formation and diffusion.
