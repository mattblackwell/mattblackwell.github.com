Hello, I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in the <a class="fn org url" href="http://www.gov.harvard.edu/">Department of
Government</a> at Harvard University. I am also an associate of the
<a class="fn org url" href="http://iq.harvard.edu">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>. 
For two years, I was the coordinator for
the <a href="http://www.iq.harvard.edu/applied_statistics_workshop_gov_3009">Applied
  Statistics Workshop</a> at IQSS. I am also a contributor to
the <a href="http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/">Social Science
Statistics blog</a> on occasion. 
</p>

<p> My research focuses on American politics and political
methodology. In American politics, I study campaigns, the
effectiveness of negative advertising, and Congressional staff
networks. In methods, I work on dynamic causal inference, missing
data, panel data, and social network analysis.
