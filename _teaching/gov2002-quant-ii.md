Quantitative methods in the social sciences are exploding. Each year researchers are deploying new and exciting methods to answer important substantive questions. But to use (and not misuse) these novel methods, it is crucial to have a firm understanding of the basic building blocks of quantitative methods in the social sciences: probability, statistical inference, and (more often than not) the linear model. This course, the second in the four-course quantitative methods sequence for PhD students in the Government department, provides this rigorous foundation necessary for the rest of the sequence and the rest of your careers. After reviewing the basic probability and statistical inference, we offer a systematic introduction to the linear model and its variants â€“ the workhorse models for social scientists. We will cover the material with enough mathematical rigor to understand the intuition and concepts, but also cover how to use statistical computing to apply the methods.
