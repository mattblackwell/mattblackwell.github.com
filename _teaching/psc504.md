Substantive questions in empirical social science research are often
causal. Does voter outreach increase turnout? Do political
institutions affect economic development? Are job training programs
effective? This graduate-level class will introduce students to both the theory and
the practice behind making these kinds of causal inferences. We will
cover causal identification, potential outcomes, experiments,
matching, regression, difference-in-differences, instrumental
variables estimation, regression discontinuity designs, sensitivity
analysis, dynamic causal inference, and more. The course will draw
upon examples from political science, economics, sociology, public
health, and public policy. Taught with R, with a mix of lectures,
discussion, and in-class computing.
