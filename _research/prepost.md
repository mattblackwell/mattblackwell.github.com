Conditioning on variables affected by treatment can induce
post-treatment bias when estimating causal effects. Although this
suggests that researchers should measure potential moderators before administering the treatment in an experiment, doing so may
also bias causal effect estimation if the covariate measurement
primes respondents to react differently to the treatment. This
paper formally analyzes this trade-off between post-treatment and
priming biases in three experimental designs that vary when
moderators are measured: pre-treatment, post-treatment, or a
randomized choice between the two. We derive nonparametric bounds
for interactions between the treatment and the moderator in each design and show how to use substantive assumptions to narrow
these bounds. These bounds allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of
their empirical findings to either source of bias.  We extend the
basic framework in two ways. First, we apply the framework to the
case of post-treatment attention checks and bound how much
inattentive respondents can attenuate estimated treatment
effects. Second, we develop a parametric Bayesian approach to
incorporate pre-treatment covariates in the analysis to sharpen our
inferences and quantify estimation uncertainty. We apply these
methods to a survey experiment on electoral messaging. We conclude
with practical recommendations for scholars designing experiments.
