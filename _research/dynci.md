Dynamic strategies are an essential part of politics. In the context
  of campaigns, for example, candidates continuously recalibrate their
  campaign strategy in response to polls and opponent actions.
  Traditional causal inference methods, however, assume that these
  dynamic decisions are made all at once, an assumption that forces a
  choice between omitted variable bias and post-treatment bias. Thus,
  these kinds of "single-shot" causal inference methods are
  inappropriate for dynamic processes like campagins. I resolve this
  dilemma by adapting models from biostatistics to estimate the
  effectiveness of an inherently dynamic process: a candidate's
  decision to "go negative." Using data from U.S. Senate and
  Gubernatorial elections (2002-2006), I find, in contrast to previous
  literature and alternative methods, that negative advertising is an
  effective campaign strategy for Democratic non-incumbents.
  Democratic incumbents, on the other hand, are hurt by their
  negativity.
