This is a textbook manuscript developed out of lecture notes for [Government 2002: Quantitative Social Science Methods II](https://gov2002.mattblackwell.org) at Harvard University. The goal of this text is to provide a rigorous yet accessible introduction to the foundational topics in statistical inference with a special application to linear regression, a workhorse tool in the social sciences. The material is intended for first-year PhD students in political science, but it may be of interest more broadly.
