*(With [James Honaker][] and [Gary King][])*

  Although social scientists devote considerable effort to mitigating
  measurement error during data collection, they often ignore the
  issue during data analysis. And although many statistical methods
  have been proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases,
  few have been widely used because of implausible assumptions, high
  levels of model dependence, difficult computation, or
  inapplicability with multiple mismeasured variables. We develop an
  easy-to-use alternative without these problems; it generalizes the
  popular multiple imputation (MI) framework by treating missing data
  problems as a limiting special case of extreme measurement error,
  and corrects for both. Like MI, the proposed framework is a simple
  two-step procedure, so that in the second step researchers can use
  whatever statistical method they would have if there had been no
  problem in the first place. We also offer empirical illustrations,
  open source software that implements all the methods described
  herein, and a companion paper with technical details and extensions.
