*(With [James Honaker][] and [Gary King][])*

  We extend a unified and easy-to-use approach to measurement error
  and missing data. Blackwell, Honaker, and King (2015a) gives an intuitive overview
  of the new technique, along with practical suggestions and empirical
  applications. Here, we offer more precise technical details; more
  sophisticated measurement error model specifications and estimation
  procedures; and analyses to assess the approach's robustness to
  correlated measurement errors and to errors in categorical
  variables. These results support using the technique to reduce bias
  and increase efficiency in a wide variety of empirical research.
